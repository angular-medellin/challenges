# Animation Face

Create an Angular Application that shows an adorable face animated
in four ways using Angular animation system:

1- **Round Out** 

2- **Rotate** 

3- **Hinge** 

 Hint:
 - take a look to  transform-origin

4- **Crazy Time** 

 Hint: 
- how many grades you think is gyrated this image? so many!... 
- while rotate, image is scaled in 3d
 
And for  last, disappear one to one the elements in the view.
